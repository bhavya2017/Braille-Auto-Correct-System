# Braille-Auto-Correct-System
I've implemented a Braille auto-correct system that handles QWERTY Braille input and provides real-time suggestions for likely intended words. The system uses a combination of Trie data structure and Levenshtein distance algorithm to efficiently handle corrections and suggestions.
